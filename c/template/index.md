From [Kori station](/kori-station) go South (there's a 7-11 on the way), follow signs pointing to [Ootsukayama](/ootsukayama). 

There's a nice lunch place between [Ootsukayama](/ootsukayama) and [Mitake](#mitake). Alternatively, you can stop for lunch at the top station of the Mitake cable car, enjoy the viewpoint there.

From the top of Hinode, take the path leading to [Mimuro-yama](#mimuroyama).

[Yoshino Baigo](/yoshino-baigo) will be on your right. The entrance fee is ¥200, free at times. Opposite of Yoshino Baigo, there's a nice little local food place with beer. Not too expensive.
