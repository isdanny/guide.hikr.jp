# TODO

## 0.5.x

* Implement remaining bits of person and photo-related API calls (read-only)
* Add options to Photo finder to pass additional filters (safe_search, extras, ...)
* Kill the ridiculous name-spacing of classes
* Implement asynchronous file upload / replacement w/ ticket checking
* Provide a better searching interface with ruby-like option syntax

## Future

* Store admin information for group (i.e. is the current user an admin for this group)
* Get a list of all sets & pools to which this photo belongs
* Get a list of recent photos uploaded from contacts
