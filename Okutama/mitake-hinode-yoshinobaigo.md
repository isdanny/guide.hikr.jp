From [Kori station](/kori-station) go South (there's a 7-11 on the way), follow signs pointing to [Ootsukayama](/ootsukayama)

There's a nice lunch place between [Ootsukayama](/ootsukayama) and [Mitake Shrine](/mitake-shrine). 

From Mitake Shrine, head on to Hinode. 

From the top of Hinode, take the path leading to [Mitsumuro-yama](/mitsumuroyama).

[Yoshino Baigo](/yoshino-baigo) will be on your right. The entrance fee is Â¥200, free at times. Opposite of Yoshino Baigo, there's a nice little local food place with beer. Not too expensive.

Optionally, on the way back, you can stop at [Kabe onsen](/kabe-onsen) ([Kabe station](/kabe-station)).
