  <h1>Hiking. With friends.</h1>
  <p>Hikr is a growing collection of hiking courses and other useful information for hikers in Japan. It's currently in open alpha phase (meaning: not ready yet).</p>
  <p>We love the outdoors, nature and spending free time actively. We believe that hiking is best in good company and regularly organize or join hikes with groups of people. Leading a hike is a big responsibility and preparation takes some work. Hikr is our tool to make finding organizing hikes easier, for experienced hikers and beginners alike.</p>

          <h4>The Engineer</h4>
          <div class="description">
            <p>Torn between the affinity for computer code and the call of the wild outdoors, Leszek is came up with the idea for Hikr as a bridge between the two worlds. Leszek is the project manager, engineer and designer behind Hikr.</p>
            <p>Born in Polish flatlands, Leszek came to Japan as a researcher. Still wondering who he'd like to be when or <em>if</em> he grows up, Leszek is enjoying the duality of Japan, where high technology meets tradition and respect for nature.</p>
