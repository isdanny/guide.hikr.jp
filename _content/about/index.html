        <h1>Hiking. With friends.</h1>
        <p>Hikr is a growing collection of hiking courses and other useful information for hikers in Japan. It's currently in open alpha phase (meaning: not ready yet).</p>
        <p>We are building Hikr out of love for the outdoors, the beauty of Japanese mountains and because we believe that hiking with fun people is time well spent.</p>

        <h2>Word of caution</h2>

        <p>Hiking is a fun and healthy way to spend free time, but should be practised with caution. When you go hiking, make sure you're well prepared and healthy.</p>

        <p>While we do our best to make sure the information on Hikr is accurate, we can't control for weather conditions, landslides, fallen trees or overflowing rivers. Please use common sense when planning a hike and, when in doubt, contact local authorities to make sure that the trail is available.</p>
